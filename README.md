## Usage

Sign-in on the platform and submit an idea or plan with all the required information. The application will then use our machine learning algorithm to match you up with a group of the most fitting mentors for your specific project. The mentors will then go through your project plan and give a score as well as feedback for each of a couple of business areas (e.g., branding, technicals, marketing, sales). This will make it easier for you to really grasp what part of your business is lacking the most and thus enable you to develop all of the crucial areas that your business needs for it to be successful.

You will work with your mentors and have regular meetings with them in order to improve the plan. As you work on your project and meet with your mentors, your scores in each area will change based on your progress. The idea is that when you have a high enough score in all the areas, your idea is ready to get shipped to the market and is likely to succeed.

The platform will also encourage you to connect with potential collaborators if needed. Organizers may also post challenges that require innovative solutions or experts to solve, encouraging collaboration and innovation.
